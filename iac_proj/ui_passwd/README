This is the UIpassword Motif Widget for AVS/Express.

The easiest method of installation is into the IAC project
framework. Instructions and the basic framework are available from the
IAC website - http://www.iavsc.org/repository/pfiles/index.shtml

This code has been tested on Linux (RedHat Enterprise 4, SuSE
Enterprise Server 9) and on x86, x86_64 and ia64 architectures. It
might work on OSX, but it is un-tested, and it is almost certainly not
suitable for Windows versions of AVS/Express yet!

This is version 1.0
